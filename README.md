# Draw3D

A small library for drawing simple shapes in 3D.

Usage is similar to the [custom drawing in 2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/2d/custom_drawing_in_2d.html) that is already present in Godot.

## Installation

Simply grab Draw3D.gd and place it somewhere in your project.

You can then add a new custom node called Draw3D, which you can use to draw stuff.

## Usage

Add the Draw3D node to your Spatial objects and then call the draw functions you want.

``` gdscript

```
